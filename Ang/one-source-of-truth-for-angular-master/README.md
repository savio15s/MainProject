# One Source of Truth for Angular 2

The components we build for our web-application often host states. Connecting components often means sharing mutable states: this is difficult to manage and leads to inconsistency.

What if we have one place for the state's mutation and let messages do the rest? [ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) is an implementation of [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for [Angular](https://angular.io/) using [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) that brings this powerful pattern into the Angular world.

This sample application will manage a realtime search using the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/), allowing the user to search for a name and to geo-localize the search results.

Play with the live example here: [live example](https://sitepoint-editors.github.io/one-source-of-truth-for-angular/).
